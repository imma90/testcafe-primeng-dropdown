# testcafe-primeng-dropdown

Minimal working example of [issue 7603 - Currently there are problems with opening the dropdown]([url](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/7602)) in the Devexpress/testcafe project on Github. Testcafe does not work properly with the basic dropdown in primeng versions 14 and 15, but does work correctly in primeng version 13.

To run the tests:
```
npx testcafe chrome
```
